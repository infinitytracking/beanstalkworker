## Pull Request Guideline

1. Ensure the solution has been discussed with the owner before starting coding
2. The PR description should contain all information to understand and test the changes

4. Document your changes, by updating the beanstalkworker example, README.md and comments in the code
5. Use [gofmt](https://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code) before committing
6. Commit small, commit often (with meaningful messages)
